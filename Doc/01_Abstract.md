- **Supervised Learning**: Classification of known fraud patterns (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Anomaly detection for unknown frauds (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)  
- **User-Specific Profiles**: Building profiles using geolocation, spending categories, and transaction frequency  
- **Real-Time Detection**: Anomaly scoring & proactive alert generation

## **Abstract**
The **Intelligent Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions** project aims to build an **adaptive, behavior-aware fraud detection framework** that reduces false positives and strengthens trust in digital banking.  

Unlike traditional rule-based systems, this model combines **supervised learning** for detecting known fraud types with **unsupervised anomaly detection** to identify unusual patterns in user-specific transactions. The system dynamically constructs a **spending profile for each user**, considering **temporal, spatial, and behavioral features** such as spending categories, transaction frequency, and geolocation.  

For detection, algorithms like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** classify suspicious activities, while **Isolation Forest** and **One-Class SVM** provide **real-time anomaly scoring**. A **proactive alert mechanism** allows users to instantly validate suspicious transactions, thereby reducing false declines and ensuring transparency.  

Beyond fraud detection, the system also offers **personalized financial insights**, including **spending analysis, budgeting recommendations, and unusual activity alerts**, enhancing customer engagement.  

This dual-purpose solution evolves with **user behavior** and **emerging fraud tactics**, positioning itself as a **next-generation fraud detection system** in financial services.
